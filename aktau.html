<p><strong>Aktau is a large industrial city on the coast of the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan, the administrative center of the Mangistau region,
located in the south-west of the country. Aktau cannot be called an ordinary regional center of this largest state in Central Asia,
 it has a special status - the only seaport in Kazakhstan is located here. And in Aktau, for the first time in the world, engineers
 supplied drinking sea water desalinated with the help of atomic energy to the city water supply system. In recent years, the industrial
 component is increasingly being squeezed by the leisure and entertainment industry, and signs of a growing tourism boom are becoming increasingly
 apparent.Figuratively speaking, a seaside town in a working overalls looks into the mirror of the Caspian Sea and tries on resort outfits.</strong></p></div>

<p>The <strong>Ustyurt</strong> plateau is the former bottom of the ancient Tethys ocean. Millions of years ago, the sea element raged here, traces of which in the form of fossilized marine life are still found here today. The canyons and cliffs of Ustyurt are a picturesque landscape.
 The inhabited land of the world - this is what the eastern poet called these meta. Rare, peculiar plants grow on the Ustyurt plateau, and wild animals and birds are found in need of protection. For this purpose, in 1984, the Ustyurt State Natural Reserve was organized.</p></div>
 <div class="culture2">
<p>Beket-Ata Myrzagul Uly was a very respected and revered Sufi in Western Kazakhstan. He was wise, kind, educated and had the gift of foresight. People came to him for advice and for a fair trial. In addition, Beket-Ata was a competent builder.
 Having chosen the desert peninsula of Mangistau for his hermitage, he built four mosques on it during his life.</p></div>
 <div class="culture3">
<p>The mountain is located between two mountain ranges of the Karatau Mountains. In ancient times, the Great Silk Road passed at its foot, and at its top, according to scientists, an impregnable fortress rose, which protected Mangistau from invading enemies. It is very difficult to climb Sherkala, but it is even more difficult to descend from it. And in its many caves it is better not to look at all: spirits live in them, which it is better not to disturb.
 Many other legends are associated with the mountain. The picturesque mountain has been portrayed more than once</p></div>

<div class="culture5">
<p><strong>Tamshaly canyon</strong> The space of the Tamshaly canyon suggests an excellent pastime for both lovers of active recreation and those who like the opposite. Here each person can be charged with the spirit of travel and amazing discoveries,
receiving as a keepsake the precious emotions received from staying in Mangystau</p>
 <div class="culture6">
<p>If you get tired of the bustle of the city and exhaust gases, go to the southeast of the city to <strong>the Park named after the First President</strong>(intersection of Navoi Street and Al-Farabi Avenue), where you can not only enjoy the beautiful views of the Tien Shan, singing fountains and scattered throughout park sculptures, but also organize a picnic in the gazebo or right on the well-groomed grass.
 The entrance to the park is free (keep in mind, you won't be allowed with four-legged friends).</p></div>
 <div class="culture7">
<p><strong>Charyn canyon.</strong> Although it is located at a distance of 200 km from the city and it is rather difficult to get there on your own, due to the absence of real asphalt roads, you simply must visit this place, because there are only two such formations in the world: the Charyn Canyon and the American Grand Canyon. An additional attraction for Marco Polo fans: several scenes of the first season were filmed here. You can get to Charyn on your own in a rented car (SUV, of course) or book an excursion (yes, the guide will broadcast all the way, but this will not prevent you from sleeping for three hours, and on the way back you will definitely want it, believe me).
An economy tour will cost you € 14.5, an individual jeep tour with a stop at the golden eagle farm will cost you € 290.</p></div>
